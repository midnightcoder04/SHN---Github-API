# GitHub API Calls
This project is pretty ambitious, trying to implement 3 features in 1 site.
Firstly there is a resume builder that works directly out of github
Secondly there is a readme explainer that has some creative ways of seeing things
Thirdly there is a space to see the most starred projects in each domain.
